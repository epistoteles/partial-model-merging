## Setup

The ffcv python package is a bit moody when you are not using conda. Before installing the requirements.txt, please run the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pkg-config libturbojpeg0-dev libopencv-dev build-essential python3-dev -y
sudo apt install cupy-cuda133 numba -y
```
